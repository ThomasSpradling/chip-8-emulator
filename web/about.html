    <h2>About CHIP-8 Emulator</h2>
    <p><a class="content-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">CHIP-8</a> is an interpreted assembly-like programming designed in the mid-1970s for some early microprocessors. It was primarily used for hobbyists to create simple video games, demonstrations, and even to be used to implement graph calculators. CHIP-8 programs had a simple instruction set whose focus was specifically around input, graphics, and audio.</p>
    <p>A CHIP-8 emulator is a software that mimics the behavior of the original virtual machine on modern platforms. This small project is my exercise towards that attempt. Currently, all features from the original CHIP-8 instruction set are implemented as well as input-detection and a display written over the HTML <a class="content-link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas API</a>. I decided not to implement the monotone audio feature associated with CHIP-8 not to distract web users, who typically wouldn't prefer sound playing from websites.</p>
    <p>I also included a few preloaded ROMs that users can access to play some of the original CHIP-8 games and demonstrations. This project overally served primarily to practice my programming skills with C++ and how it interfaces with the web via the <a class="content-link" href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a> compiler toolchain.</p>
